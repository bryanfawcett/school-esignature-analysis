```csv
Form Name, Count, Type (optional)
Digital Citizenship Agreement, 1239
Faculty Contract, 213, Contract
Device Acceptance Form, 173
Parent Permission Form, 89, Consent
```

### Step 2: Upload & Analyze
1. Visit the [live tool](https://school-esignature-analysis.pages.dev/)
2. Click "Upload Your School's Data"
3. Drag & drop or select your CSV file
4. Get instant analysis with optimization recommendations

### Step 3: Review Results

- **Form-by-Form Analysis** - Detailed recommendations for each form type
- **Implementation Priority** - High-impact changes identified first
- **Compliance Protection** - Legal documents automatically preserved

## 🤖 Smart Classification Algorithm

The tool uses an intelligent algorithm to categorize forms based on educational best practices:

### ✅ **Convert to Approval Workflow**
- **Policy Acknowledgments**: Digital citizenship, codes of conduct, handbooks
- **Administrative Processes**: Device forms, reimbursements, professional development
- **Information Updates**: Contact details, passport information, emergency contacts
- **High-Volume Routine**: Forms with >500 transactions likely suitable for approval

### ✍️ **Preserve as E-Signature**
- **Employment Contracts**: Faculty, staff, coach agreements
- **Parent Consents**: Field trips, medical permissions, activity waivers
- **Legal Documents**: Board petitions, vendor agreements, financial contracts
- **Student Contracts**: Transcript releases, program participation agreements

### 🎯 **Classification Criteria**
- **Keyword Analysis**: Scans form names for legal/contractual terms
- **Volume Assessment**: High-volume forms prioritized for optimization
- **Risk Evaluation**: Conservative approach for unclear classifications
- **Educational Context**: Designed specifically for K-12 school environments

## 📈 Expected Benefits

### Quantitative Improvements
- **30-50% reduction** in e-signature processing time
