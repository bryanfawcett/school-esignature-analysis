## 📋 Executive Summary

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of electronic signature form usage at Singapore American School, demonstrating a strategic approach to optimize e-signature workflows while maintaining legal compliance and operational efficiency.

### 🎯 Key Findings
- **15,131 total transactions** analyzed from real school data
- **40.7% reduction potential** in e-signature requirements
- **6,161 forms** suitable for approval-based workflows
- **Zero compromise** on legal compliance for contracts and consents

## 🔍 Analysis Overview

Our data-driven approach examined every form transaction to identify optimization opportunities:

| Metric | Before Optimization | After Optimization | Improvement |
